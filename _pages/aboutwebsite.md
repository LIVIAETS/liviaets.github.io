# LIVIA Lab Website

This website showcases the research and activities of the [Laboratoire d'Imagerie, de Vision et d'Intelligence Artificielle (LIVIA)](https://liviamtl.ca/) at [École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS)](https://www.etsmtl.ca/), Université du Québec, Montreal.

### About LIVIA

LIVIA is dedicated to the perception and modeling of dynamic environments (2D and 3D scenes, speech, etc.) using techniques in artificial intelligence. Our laboratory focuses on large-scale processing, analysis and interpretation of images and videos.

**Research Focus:**

Our research and development activities are based on six main conceptual axes:

1. Machine learning
2. Computer vision
3. Pattern recognition
4. Adaptive and intelligent systems
5. Information fusion
6. Optimization of complex systems

**Applications:**

The techniques developed at LIVIA solve concrete and complex problems in:

- Analysis of medical, satellite, and aerial images
- Biometrics: recognition of individuals from signature, face, voice, etc.
- Automatic processing of handwritten documents
- Affective computing for health monitoring
- Security and surveillance

We develop cutting-edge solutions such as convolutional neural networks to detect tumors or assess depression levels in patients, working with massive amounts of data that typically has limited annotations.

### Website Technical Details

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and uses [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) and [Bootswatch](http://www.bootswatch.com). The original template was created by the Allan Lab and has been adapted for LIVIA.

**Structure:**
- All pages are written in markdown for easy editing
- Publication lists, news items, and team members are stored as `.yml` data sheets in the `_data` folder
- Pages are located in the `_pages` folder
- Jekyll generates HTML files in the `_site` folder
